Welcome
=======

Hi, I'm Matthew Malensek, a graduate student in the [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.colostate.edu) at Colorado State University.  I work as a research assistant for [Shrideep Pallickara](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~shrideep) and [Sangmi Pallickara](http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~sangmi), and my research interests are centered around distributed systems and data-intensive computing.  Some of the projects I am involved with include:

* [Galileo](http://galileo.cs.colostate.edu), a high-throughput distributed storage system
* [Granules](http://granules.cs.colostate.edu), a framework for distributed stream processing
* Failure recovery and fault tolerance functionality for discrete event simulations

This site serves as a place to host my projects, publications, and other miscellaneous things that need somewhere to live on the web.
