wake
----

Wake (web make) is a **very** simple static website generator. It takes a set of inputs (such as markdown files) and if they've changed it produces the output files (usually HTML). Basically, it's a purpose-built 'make' utility, and in fact originally just generated Makefiles.

Wake likely lacks some of the cooler features of the more famous static site generators, but its codebase is pretty small and should be easy to extend.
